# 1st step is to ask the value of radius from the user.

r = float(input("Enter the value of the radius = "))



#now let's calculate the area by multiplying radius by pie(3.14) powered by 2



area = 3.14 * r ** 2



# now let's print the output using print function.

print("The area of the circle with radius" , r "is ", area)
